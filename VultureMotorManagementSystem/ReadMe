After downloading the repo, make sure the "database path" in Task8.LogInLauncher class is the one corresponding to the path on your machine. 
Make sure that all the drivers and libraries(JDBC, JCalendar, JFreeChart...etc) found in the project document, are present in the project library for the system to work.
If you're unable to log in with the user details described above, you can access the sqlite directory inside the project folder and import data as per database schema.

Thanks!
